# JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS AND TUTORIALS

#### Tags: JavaScript

## ABOUT
Series of projects and code snippets from tutorials on a variety of platforms
in JS. Each directory is named after the primary JS technology that the
code within contains, though some tutorials may (and likely will) use more than
a single framework. These are meant to be simple, and not at all production-ready;
the aim is to learn and familiarize myself with aspects of JS, not to create
production-level modules. Any errors, of course, are mine - I'm especially good
at those.

Each upper-level directory has, within it, directories for each project. There
_should_ (me, forget? _Never!_) contain within it a README that describes the gist
of the project, including a **TAGS** section that lists the framework or JS technique
that the project concentrates on, in order of percieved concentration (i.e. an ajaxi
tutorial would have ajax listed first, but may use some php too, so that's listed
as well).
